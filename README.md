# Known to be broken. Accepting PRs.

This worked for me two years ago when my oldest child left daycare, and I haven't touched it since. It scrapes the HiMama website and as their site changes, it will break. My youngest is now leaving daycare so I'll put a fixed version up in coming weeks, and then I'll have no opportunity to work on it further.

# himama-dl

An unofficial bulk downloader for [HiMama](https://www.himama.com) "Activities" (photos/videos).

This scrapes your kid's activities through the website, and it's likely to be quite brittle.

`himama-dl` will prompt you for your HiMama credentials, then use it to scrape a list of children/account IDs out of HiMama.com.
It will then allow you to select which child to download activities for, and then output each childs activities in a subdirector.

A typical page of contains activities that look like this:

`himama-dl` will download each attached photo or video and name it according to its "Added by", "Date", "Title', and a short hash to ensure uniqueness, for example:

```
